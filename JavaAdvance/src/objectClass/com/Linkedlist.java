//What is Linked List.
/*
 * Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are
 * randomly stored in the memory. A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at
 * that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the
 * next node in the memory.
 */

//In linked List we have previous and next reference and an value .

//Difference Between ArrayList and Linked List.
/*
 * Although ArrayList & LinkedList both implement the List interface and have
 * the same methods, it is important to understand when to use which one.
 * 
 * The insertion & deletion can be done in constant time in Linked List, so it
 * is best to use the linked list when you need to add or remove elements
 * frequently.But, in arrays/ArrayList, if we want to add or delete an element
 * in between then, we need to shift all the other elements.
 * 
 * Use ArrayList when you want to access the random elements frequently, as it
 * canâ€™t be done in a linked list in constant time.
